Problem Statement:-
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
Need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:-
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Used regularization techniques(Ridge and Lasso Regression) to solve the problem.
